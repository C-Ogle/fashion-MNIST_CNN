# Fashion-MNIST Simple CNN Parameter Experiment

This notebook explores the performance of a simple Convolutional Neural Network through experimentation with three key parameters:

* Filter Size
* Number of Features
* Batch Size

The notebook begins by training a simple CNN as a baseline, and then uses this same CNN structure to perform a factorial experiment using a small selection of values for the three parameters listed above. 
Afterwards, the results of this experiment and the key takeaways are discussed. Additionally, a brief explanation of the function of each of these parameters is included for quick reference.
